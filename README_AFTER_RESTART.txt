Clean slate done.

Everything was removed:
- DebuggingProjects (the repo we cloned)
- EVAITCS-Challenges
- EVAITCSCodingChallenges (if it was there)
- All the guide files I added (LEARNING_AND_CONTRIBUTING_GUIDE, FIX_LONG_PATHS, etc.)

Nothing was ever committed by me — those were only local files. So there is nothing to "uncommit"; everything is just deleted.

After you restart, tell me you're ready. I will teach you step by step (no automation):
- What a repository is
- What clone means and how to run it yourself
- What commit means and how to do it yourself
- How to get the repos and work with them

You will run the commands; I will explain.
